I created this codebook for a class project with the aim of wrangling a dataset and recoding it to prepare it for data manipulation. For this project, I selected the World Bank's data on Afghanistan due to its extensive range of variables and observations, despite its initial lack of cleanliness. I undertook tasks such as renaming variables, recoding missing values, and expanding the dataset both in length and width to make it ready for manipulation
